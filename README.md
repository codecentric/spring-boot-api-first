# API first Spring Boot Service (WIP)

This Spring Boot Service will be created by the API first approach and tested with [Karate](https://intuit.github.io/karate/). Due to missing capability of OpenAPI Generator in Version 5.0.0 the direct download of the API spec is not possible at the moment. So we will rely on using [Gradle Download Task](https://github.com/michel-kraemer/gradle-download-task). There is also already a [bug report](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/8255) written by [joschi](https://github.com/joschi).

At the moment the blog post can be finalized with the workaround in mind. Also a good idea to test the "update feature" on the codecentric blog next year.
