 # API first Spring Boot Service (WIP)

 This Spring Boot Service will be created by the API first approach and tested with [Karate](https://intuit.github.io/karate/). Due to missing capability of OpenAPI Generator in Version 5.0.0 the direct download of the API spec is not possible at the moment. So we will rely on using [Gradle Download Task](https://github.com/michel-kraemer/gradle-download-task). There is also already a [bug report](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/8255) written by [joschi](https://github.com/joschi). And there is an open [feature request](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/9083) for OpenAPI Generator to support OpenAPI Spec 3.1. 
 During the writing process OpenAPI Generator was removed and replaced [OpenAPI Processor](https://docs.openapiprocessor.io/oap/home/home.html).
